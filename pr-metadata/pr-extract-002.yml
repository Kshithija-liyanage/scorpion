  title: "Implement Payment Processing System"
  description: |
    As a customer, I want to be able to make secure payments within the application
    so that I can purchase products and services without leaving the platform.
    
    This story involves implementing a robust payment processing system that integrates
    with Stripe as the primary payment gateway. The system should handle credit card
    payments, refunds, and payment status tracking.
    
    Requirements:
    - Secure credit card processing through Stripe
    - Support for various payment methods (credit cards, digital wallets)
    - Comprehensive payment validation
    - Refund processing capabilities
    - Payment history tracking and reporting

    title: "Payment validation fails for valid international cards"
    description: |
      The payment validation system is incorrectly flagging valid international
      credit cards as invalid, particularly cards from European and Asian countries.
      This is preventing international customers from completing their purchases.
    rca: |
      The card validation logic was using US-specific validation rules for all cards,
      which doesn't account for different BIN ranges and card number formats used
      in international cards. Additionally, the AVS (Address Verification System)
      was configured to require exact matches, which doesn't work well with
      international addresses.
    resolution: |
      Updated the card validation logic to use region-specific validation rules
      based on the card's BIN number. Modified the AVS settings to be more flexible
      with international addresses while maintaining security.

          We're seeing a significant drop in conversion rates for international
          customers. Based on support tickets, many are unable to complete payment
          due to card validation failures despite having valid cards.

          I've identified the issue in the PaymentValidator class. It's using
          a US-centric validation library that doesn't properly handle international
          card formats. Will implement a fix using a more comprehensive validation
          approach.

          Fix implemented in commit b8d92e1. I've also added comprehensive tests
          with sample card numbers from different regions to ensure we don't
          encounter similar issues in the future.

    title: "Refund process creates duplicate refund attempts"
    description: |
      When a refund is initiated, the system occasionally creates duplicate
      refund attempts in the payment gateway, causing accounting discrepancies
      and customer confusion when they receive multiple refund notifications.
    rca: |
      The refund process wasn't properly handling retry scenarios. When a refund
      request timed out or returned an ambiguous response, the system would
      automatically retry without checking if the original request actually
      succeeded on the payment gateway's side.
    resolution: |
      Implemented an idempotency key system for refunds and added a verification
      step that checks the payment gateway for existing refunds before initiating
      a new refund request. Also added a reconciliation process to detect and
      resolve any duplicate refunds.

          We're seeing discrepancies in our monthly reconciliation with Stripe.
          Several customers have received double refunds, impacting our financials
          by approximately $12,500 this month.

          After investigating the logs, I found that our system is creating duplicate
          refund requests when the initial request times out. The issue is in the
          error handling logic of the StripePaymentProcessor class.

          Approved the fix with the idempotency implementation. This is a critical
          issue affecting our financial reporting. Please prioritize testing and
          deployment.
