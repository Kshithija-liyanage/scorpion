  title: "Implement Notification System"
  description: |
    As a user, I want to receive timely notifications about relevant events
    so that I can stay informed about important updates and actions required.
    
    This story involves implementing a comprehensive notification system that
    supports multiple channels including email, in-app notifications, and
    potentially SMS. The system should be templated, trackable, and allow
    users to manage their notification preferences.
    
    Requirements:
    - Email notification service with templating
    - Notification delivery tracking
    - User notification preferences management
    - Support for different notification types and priorities
    - Batch processing for high-volume notifications

    title: "Email notifications not respecting user timezone settings"
    description: |
      Users are receiving email notifications at inappropriate times because
      the system is not respecting their configured timezone preferences.
      For example, users in Australia are receiving "daily digest" emails
      at 3 AM their local time instead of the intended morning delivery.
    rca: |
      The EmailNotificationService was using the server's timezone (UTC)
      for scheduling all notifications instead of converting timestamps
      to each user's local timezone before determining delivery time.
      The issue was in the sendTemplatedEmail method which wasn't
      passing the user's timezone information to the template renderer.
    resolution: |
      Modified the notification scheduling system to account for user timezone
      preferences. Added timezone conversion utilities and updated the
      template rendering process to include timezone-specific formatting
      for dates and times.

          We've received multiple complaints from users in APAC region about
          receiving notifications at inappropriate hours. This is especially
          problematic for the daily digest emails which should arrive during
          morning hours.

          I've traced this to the notification scheduling system. It's using
          server time (UTC) for all users regardless of their timezone settings.
          Will implement a fix that respects user timezone preferences.

          Verified the fix in staging. Notifications are now being delivered
          at appropriate times according to each user's timezone settings.

    title: "Notification templates failing with special characters"
    description: |
      Email notifications containing special characters (particularly non-Latin
      alphabets and emojis) are being rendered incorrectly or failing to send
      entirely. This affects users with non-English names and content.
    rca: |
      The NotificationTemplateManager was using an outdated template engine
      that didn't properly support UTF-8 encoding. Additionally, the email
      sending service wasn't setting the correct content-type headers for
      internationalized content.
    resolution: |
      Updated the template engine to a newer version with proper UTF-8 support.
      Modified the email sending service to set appropriate content-type headers
      (text/html; charset=UTF-8). Added comprehensive tests with international
      character sets and emojis.

          We've noticed that notifications containing Japanese, Chinese, and
          Korean characters are being displayed as question marks or empty
          boxes. This is affecting our expansion into Asian markets.

          The issue is in the template rendering system. It's using an older
          version of the template engine that doesn't properly handle UTF-8.
          I'll update it to the latest version which has better international
          character support.

          This is a high-priority issue for our international users. Many are
          reporting that their names are being displayed incorrectly in emails,
          which looks unprofessional.

          Fix implemented in commit c45d9a2. We've also added comprehensive
          tests with various international character sets to prevent regression.
