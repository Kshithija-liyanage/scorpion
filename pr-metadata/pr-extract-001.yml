  title: "Implement OAuth Authentication"
  description: |
    As a user, I want to be able to authenticate using my existing social media accounts
    so that I don't have to create and remember another set of credentials.
    
    This story involves implementing OAuth authentication flow with major providers
    including Google, Facebook, and GitHub. The implementation should follow the
    OAuth 2.0 protocol and securely handle user tokens.
    
    Requirements:
    - Support for multiple OAuth providers
    - Secure token storage and management
    - Proper error handling for failed authentication attempts
    - User profile integration with OAuth provider data

    title: "Token validation fails for expired tokens"
    description: |
      Token validation is not properly checking expiration dates, causing
      users to remain authenticated even after their tokens have expired.
      This creates a security vulnerability where unauthorized access could
      potentially occur.
    rca: |
      The TokenManager.validateToken() method was only checking the token
      signature but not validating the expiration timestamp in the JWT claims.
    resolution: |
      Added proper expiration validation in the TokenManager.validateToken() method.
      Now tokens are checked for both signature validity and expiration time.

          I've noticed this issue when testing the authentication flow. Users
          remain logged in even after I manually expire their tokens in the database.

          Fixed in commit a7e23f9. Added comprehensive token validation that checks
          not only expiration but also issuer and audience claims.

    title: "OAuth callback handling fails with state parameter mismatch"
    description: |
      When users are redirected back from the OAuth provider, the state parameter
      validation sometimes fails, causing the authentication process to abort.
      This happens especially when users take longer than expected to complete
      the OAuth flow on the provider's side.
    rca: |
      The state parameter was being stored in the session with a 5-minute expiration,
      but some users take longer than that to complete the authentication on the
      provider's site, especially when they need to create an account first.
    resolution: |
      Extended the state parameter session timeout to 15 minutes and added better
      error messaging to guide users if the state validation fails.

          This is affecting approximately 8% of our OAuth authentication attempts
          according to the analytics. Most failures happen with new users who need
          to create accounts with the provider first.

          I've implemented the fix with the extended timeout. Also added a recovery
          flow that allows users to restart the authentication process with a clear
          error message if the state validation fails.

          Verified the fix in staging environment. The extended timeout successfully
          resolves the issue for most users. The recovery flow also works as expected.
