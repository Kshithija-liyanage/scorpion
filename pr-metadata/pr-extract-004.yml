  title: "Implement Data Analytics System"
  description: |
    As a business stakeholder, I want to track and analyze user behavior within the application
    so that I can make data-driven decisions to improve user experience and business outcomes.
    
    This story involves implementing a comprehensive data analytics system that captures
    user interactions, processes the data, and provides meaningful insights through
    reports and dashboards. The system should be scalable, respect user privacy,
    and integrate with our existing data warehouse.
    
    Requirements:
    - User activity tracking across the application
    - Data processing and aggregation capabilities
    - Pattern recognition for user behavior analysis
    - Integration with business intelligence tools
    - Privacy-compliant data collection and storage

    title: "Analytics data processing causing performance degradation"
    description: |
      The real-time analytics data processing is causing significant performance
      degradation during peak usage hours. Users are experiencing slow response
      times and occasional timeouts when the analytics system is processing
      large volumes of data.
    rca: |
      The AnalyticsDataProcessor was running synchronously in the main request
      thread, causing user requests to be blocked while analytics data was being
      processed. Additionally, the data aggregation queries were not optimized
      and were causing excessive database load.
    resolution: |
      Refactored the analytics processing to run asynchronously using a message
      queue system. Implemented a batching mechanism to process data in chunks
      during off-peak hours. Optimized the database queries with proper indexing
      and caching strategies.

          We've observed a significant increase in response times coinciding with
          the deployment of the new analytics system. Average response time has
          increased from 120ms to 450ms during peak hours.

          After profiling the application, I've identified that the analytics
          data processing is running synchronously in the request thread. This
          is causing a bottleneck, especially when processing complex user
          journeys.

          We need to move this to an asynchronous processing model. I recommend
          using our existing message queue infrastructure to offload the processing
          from the main request thread.

          Implementation complete in commit d34a8f2. I've moved all analytics
          processing to an async worker and implemented batching. Initial tests
          show response times have returned to normal levels.

    title: "User activity reports showing incorrect data for multi-session users"
    description: |
      The user activity reports are showing incorrect data for users who have
      multiple active sessions (e.g., mobile and web simultaneously). Activities
      are being double-counted or attributed to the wrong session, leading to
      misleading analytics.
    rca: |
      The UserActivityAnalyzer was using the user ID as the primary key for
      aggregating activities without considering the session context. This
      caused activities from different sessions to be merged incorrectly
      during the aggregation process.
    resolution: |
      Modified the activity tracking system to use a composite key of user ID
      and session ID for storing activities. Updated the aggregation logic to
      properly handle multi-session scenarios while still providing user-level
      insights when needed.

          We've noticed anomalies in the user engagement metrics. Some users
          appear to have impossible activity patterns, like clicking on elements
          on multiple pages simultaneously.

          This appears to be happening with users who are active on multiple
          devices simultaneously. The system is treating all sessions as one,
          causing confusion in the activity timeline.

          Verified the issue by testing with multiple simultaneous sessions.
          The activities are indeed being merged incorrectly in the reports.

          Fix implemented in commit e56b92c. Now properly tracking session
          context with activities. Added comprehensive tests for multi-session
          scenarios.
