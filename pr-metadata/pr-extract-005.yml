  title: "Implement Product Catalog System"
  description: |
    As a customer, I want to browse and search through a comprehensive product catalog
    so that I can find and purchase products that meet my needs.
    
    This story involves implementing a robust product catalog system that supports
    efficient product storage, categorization, searching, and inventory management.
    The system should be optimized for performance even with large catalogs and
    support rich product metadata.
    
    Requirements:
    - Efficient product data storage and retrieval
    - Hierarchical category management
    - Advanced search capabilities with filtering
    - Real-time inventory tracking
    - Support for product variants and attributes

    title: "Product search returning incorrect results for multi-word queries"
    description: |
      The product search functionality is returning incorrect or incomplete results
      when users search with multi-word queries. For example, searching for "blue cotton shirt"
      returns results for "blue shirt" but misses products that are specifically tagged
      as "cotton" or have "cotton" in their description.
    rca: |
      The ProductRepository.searchProducts method was using an OR condition between
      search terms instead of an AND condition, causing it to return products that
      match any of the search terms rather than all of them. Additionally, the search
      was only looking at product names and not considering other relevant fields like
      description and material attributes.
    resolution: |
      Modified the search algorithm to use AND logic between search terms by default,
      with an option to use OR logic if specified. Expanded the search to include
      product descriptions, attributes, and category tags. Implemented relevance
      scoring to prioritize results that match more terms.

          In our latest user testing sessions, we observed that 7 out of 10 users
          were unable to find products using specific multi-word searches. This is
          significantly impacting the shopping experience.

          After reviewing the search implementation, I found that we're using OR logic
          between search terms, which explains why users are getting too many irrelevant
          results. We should switch to AND logic as the default.

          This is a high-priority issue affecting conversion rates. Our analytics show
          that users who use multi-word searches have a 45% lower conversion rate
          compared to single-word searches.

          Fix implemented in commit f78b21e. We've also added a more sophisticated
          relevance scoring system that should improve search quality overall.

    title: "Category tree performance degradation with deep hierarchies"
    description: |
      The category management system is experiencing significant performance issues
      when dealing with deep category hierarchies (more than 5 levels deep). This
      is causing slow page loads on category browsing pages and timeouts during
      category tree updates.
    rca: |
      The CategoryManager.getCategoryTree method was using a recursive approach
      to build the category tree, which resulted in exponential time complexity
      for deep hierarchies. Additionally, the database queries weren't optimized
      for hierarchical data, causing multiple round-trips to the database.
    resolution: |
      Refactored the category tree implementation to use a non-recursive approach
      with a single optimized database query using Common Table Expressions (CTEs).
      Implemented caching for the category tree with appropriate invalidation
      strategies. Added pagination support for large category listings.

          We're seeing timeouts on the category management pages, particularly
          for departments with complex category hierarchies like Electronics
          and Home Goods. This is affecting the merchandising team's ability
          to update the catalog.

          The issue is in the recursive implementation of the category tree builder.
          It's making a separate database query for each category node, which becomes
          extremely inefficient for deep hierarchies. We need to refactor this to
          use a more efficient approach.

          We recommend using a CTE (Common Table Expression) to fetch the entire
          category hierarchy in a single query. This is much more efficient for
          hierarchical data structures.

          Implemented the CTE approach in commit g92e45a. Also added caching with
          a 15-minute TTL to further improve performance. Initial tests show a 95%
          reduction in load time for deep category hierarchies.
